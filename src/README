                Sources for the Thomas implementation

All files here are implementation independent (as far as we know)
EXCEPT for those starting with "scc-", "mit-", or "gambit-".

                            Load-Up Files

These files simply load others.  Each file has a brief comment
describing the ones it loads.

load-compiler.scm builds a Thomas to Scheme compiler.
load-runtime.scm builds a Scheme implementation of the Thomas runtime
  system.
load-thomas.scm loads both the compiler and the runtime system as well
  as the file rep.scm which contains an interactive read-eval-print
  loop for Thomas.
